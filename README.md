# Flavorful Palate

👋 Hi there! Welcome to my recipe website, one of my initial solo endeavors in web development. 
Crafted with Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. Here are the main features and what I've learned:

🏠 Home: Discover a world of flavors and get surprised with a random recipe every visit. 
Easily access ingredients, cooking steps, and show your love by 'liking' recipes, adding them to your personal favorites.

❤️ Favourites: Your personal recipe haven! Access all your liked recipes in one place, thanks to seamless localStorage integration.

🔍 Flavor Search: Craving something specific? Simply type keywords in the search bar, and watch as it serves up mouthwatering dishes 
fetched from a vast recipe API. If it can't find a match, it'll kindly let you know.

## Key Learnings:

### 1️⃣ Frontend Mastery:
This project honed my frontend development skills, enabling me to create a smooth and engaging user experience.

### 🗄️ LocalStorage: 
In this project, I've harnessed the power of localStorage to seamlessly store and retrieve data. With localStorage, users can effortlessly keep track of their liked recipes, creating a personalized collection that persists across visits. It's a game-changer in enhancing user experience and interaction, making the website not just informative but also user-centric

### 🌐 API Integration: 
The art of fetching data from an API and seamlessly integrating it into the website was a pivotal skill I honed. 
It's fascinating to see real-time recipe data come to life.

### 🙌 User Interaction Magic: 
Implementing features like the 'like' button opened up a world of user engagement. User interaction and ability to build 
recipe collections added a whole new layer to the project.
